# Mini Blockchain with Proof of Work Implementation in Python

## Description
This project implements a mini blockchain with a proof of work algorithm in Python. The blockchain is designed to operate on a small scale, allowing you to understand the concepts of a blockchain and proof of work without the complexity of a full-scale implementation. It provides functionalities for creating blocks, validating transactions, mining blocks using proof of work, and maintaining the integrity of the blockchain.

# Mine blocks using a proof of work algorithm (but let's be honest, it doesn't make you rich!).
